Another one of those admin panels for Arma 3 Altis Life

Hello! I am ZeroByter, and although I don't anymore, I used to play on a LOT of Arma 2 & 3 Island Life servers, and eventually I started developing for them.
But soon enough, I got tired of always using Cyberwork's panel or some other panel which would almost always not live up to our needs and would usually require modifications and our own custom additions.

And so, I decided to create ZeroPanel! The ZeroPanel admin panel is designed in mind for Arma 3 Island Life, although there is no reason it shouldn't work with Arma 2 Island Life & Takistan Life as well.
ZeroPanel is wholly inspired and designed after Cyberwork's panel. ZeroPanel simply has less bugs, more features such as a working RCon system, and more.

If you have any installation problems or difficulties, feel free to create a new issue here on the GitHub, I will respond to your problems and will probably even come down to your TeamSpeak to offer you direct assistance.
